## Subtle activity emoji animations
Add small animated emoji/icons per activity type (e.g., basketball for FLAS Basketball, ping pong paddle for Table Tennis, shuttlecock for Badminton). Consider subtle animations like a gentle bounce, spin, or sway to add personality without being distracting. Consult UX design agent for best practices on micro-animations and icon selection.
