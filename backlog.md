# Backlog

## Done

### ~~P1: Improve timeline bar segment contrast in dark mode~~
Bumped past segment opacity (open-gym 0.3→0.45, scheduled 0.25→0.4). Deployed 2026-02-15.

### ~~P1: Add PWA support (install to home screen)~~
Added manifest.json, service worker, and app icons. Deployed 2026-02-15.

### ~~P4: PWA offline support~~
Rewrote service worker with real caching (network-first HTML/data, cache-first hashed assets), added offline banner, auto-reload on SW update, enhanced manifest. Deployed 2026-02-16.

### ~~P2: Unofficial disclaimer with link to official site~~
Added disclaimer paragraph in footer with link to Borough of Fair Lawn. Deployed 2026-02-15.

### ~~P2: Auto-refresh live data~~
Extracted loadSchedule() and added visibilitychange listener to refresh after 5+ min away. Deployed 2026-02-15.

### ~~P3: Mobile timeline list — show end times~~
Added end times with ndash separator, adjusted min-width and font-size. Deployed 2026-02-15.

### ~~P3: Deployment cache busting~~
Resolved by P4 PWA offline support — service worker uses network-first for HTML and data, cache-first for hashed assets. Users get fresh content on every online visit.

### ~~P5: Accessibility audit & unit testing setup~~
Skip link, focus-visible styles, color contrast verification (all pass WCAG AA). Vitest with 62 tests for time.ts, emoji.ts, motivational.ts. Merged 2026-02-16.

### ~~P2: Subtle activity emoji animations~~
StatusCard already has `emoji-breathe` animation (scale 1→1.12, 3s, with `prefers-reduced-motion` support). WeeklySchedule intentionally omits animation — animating dozens of emojis in a static list would be distracting. Done.

### ~~P3: CI — run tests on push~~
Added `.github/workflows/ci.yml` with parallel `test` (vitest + build) and `e2e` (Playwright) jobs. Triggers on push/PR to main, ignores `public/data/**` bot commits. Merged 2026-02-16.

### ~~P4: Scraper test coverage~~
Extracted pure parsing functions to `scraper/parse.ts`, deduplicated types (imports from `src/lib/types.ts`), fixed `parseHeaderDate` TZ/year-boundary bugs. Added ~32 tests in `scraper/parse.test.ts` with committed fixture (`scraper/fixtures/page.txt`). Merged 2026-02-16.

### ~~P4: E2E smoke test with Playwright~~
Added `@playwright/test`, `playwright.config.ts`, and 4 E2E smoke tests in `e2e/smoke.spec.ts`: page load, status card render, skip link focus, weekly schedule toggle. Uses `vite preview` for production-like testing. Merged 2026-02-16.

### ~~P5: `computeGymState` gap behavior refinement~~
Won't fix. The scraper fills all gaps within open gym ranges with "Open Gym" slots, so gaps in `computeGymState` only occur when no open gym range is defined — an edge case that doesn't happen with real data. Current behavior (countdown to next activity) is reasonable.

### ~~P3: Scraper resilience monitoring~~
Added `scraper/validate.ts` with 8 validation rules (timestamp, day completeness, activity counts, time format/logic). Scraper exits non-zero on failure, preventing bad data from being committed. Workflow creates/updates a GitHub issue on failure with deduplication. 13 unit tests in `scraper/validate.test.ts`. Deployed 2026-02-16.

### ~~P4: Playwright browser caching in CI~~
Cache `~/.cache/ms-playwright` with `actions/cache@v4` keyed on exact Playwright version. On cache hit, only install OS deps (`install-deps`); on miss, full `install --with-deps`. Applied to both `ci.yml` and `scrape-and-deploy.yml`. Merged 2026-02-16.

## Open

### P4: Service worker test coverage
The service worker has meaningful logic (network-first vs cache-first strategy, offline detection, auto-reload on update) but no tests. Add vitest tests to verify the caching strategy selection logic.

### P5: Lighthouse CI budget
With CI in place, add a Lighthouse budget check to catch performance regressions (bundle size growth, accessibility score drops) automatically on PRs.
