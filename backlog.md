## Open

### P2: Subtle activity emoji animations
Add small animated emoji/icons per activity type (e.g., basketball for FLAS Basketball, ping pong paddle for Table Tennis, shuttlecock for Badminton). Consider subtle animations like a gentle bounce, spin, or sway to add personality without being distracting. Consult UX design agent for best practices on micro-animations and icon selection.

### ~~P3: Deployment cache busting~~
Resolved by P4 PWA offline support — service worker uses network-first for HTML and data, cache-first for hashed assets. Users get fresh content on every online visit.

### P5: Accessibility audit & unit testing setup
Skip link, focus-visible styles, color contrast verification. Vitest for core business logic (time.ts, emoji.ts, motivational.ts).
